### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring developer who is interested in the intersection of technology and real estate investing. My background includes 8 years working in real estate private equity. I started learning how to code in 2020. I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.jigsawlabs.io/">Jigsaw Labs'</a> Data Engineering program. I live in NYC with my wife and dog and can be found in my free time exploring the outdoors.
