### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring developer who is interested in the intersection of technology and real estate investing. My background includes 8 years working in real estate private equity. I started learning how to code in 2020. I'm currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.jigsawlabs.io/">Jigsaw Labs'</a> Data Engineering program. I live in NYC with my wife and dog and can be found in my free time exploring the outdoors.

## Projects

#### <a href="https://github.com/cwaskom/jigsaw_project"> Hotel Rates </a
This project calls the Amadeus Hotel Search API and extracts hotel rates for luxury hotels. This data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database with multiple tables. A Flask app is used to serve requested data to a Streamlist frontend.
