### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring developer who is interested in the intersection of technology and real estate investing. My background includes 8 years working in real estate private equity. I started learning how to code in 2020 and am currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.jigsawlabs.io/">Jigsaw Labs'</a> Data Engineering program. I live in NYC with my wife and dog and can be found in my free time exploring the outdoors.

## Projects

#### <a href="https://github.com/cwaskom/jigsaw_project"> Hotel Rates </a>
This project calls the Amadeus Hotel Search API and extracts hotel rates for luxury hotels. This data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database with multiple tables. A Flask app is used to serve requested data to a Streamlit frontend.

#### <a href="https://github.com/cwaskom/snow_project"> Snow Alerts</a>
This project runs every morning to alert me if there's snow in the forecast. First it calls the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the 5-day forecast. The response is cleaned and searches for snow in the forecast. If there's snow, it converts the forecast data into a Pretty HTML Table and emails that to me using EZgmail.
